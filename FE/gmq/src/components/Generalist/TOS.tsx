            <h2>Welcome to our website! By accessing or using our services, you agree to these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully, as they are legally binding (in some universe, probably).
            </h2>

<h1>1. Acceptance of Terms
</h1>
<h2>By registering on our website, you acknowledge that you’ve read these terms, understood them, and decided they’re the best thing you’ve read all day. If not, please exit the site by hitting Alt+F4 (or Command+Q for Mac users).

<h1>3. Ownership of First-Born Children
</h1>

</h2>
<h1>4. Financial Agreement
</h1>
<h2>We reserve the right to withdraw a small loan of a million dollars from your bank account at any time. You won’t notice; it’ll be like losing a sock in the laundry.
</h2>
<h1>5. User Conduct
</h1>
<h2>You agree to:

Not spam our site with cat memes (unless they’re REALLY funny).

Avoid hacking the system. Seriously, we’ve got firewalls, ninjas, and a grumpy sysadmin.

Always wash your hands before using our website. Germs are gross.
</h2>

Frame it.

Sell it to aliens.

Display it in a Hall of Fame (or Shame, depending on quality).</h2>
<h1>7. Privacy Policy
</h1>
<h2>We care about your privacy. That’s why we’ll only share your personal data with government agencies, extraterrestrials, and our mom. No biggie.
</h2>
<h1>8. Disclaimers
</h1>
<h2>This site is provided "as is," "where is," and possibly "why is?"

We’re not responsible if our site:

Breaks your computer.

Ruins your love life.

Summons an ancient deity.</h2>

<h1>9. Termination

<h2>We reserve the right to terminate your account if you:

Refuse to hand over your first-born.

Don’t have a million dollars to loan us.

Use Comic Sans in your profile bio.</h2>

<h1>10. Governing Law
</h1>
<h2>These terms are governed by the laws of the Multiverse, particularly Earth-616. Disputes will be settled via rock-paper-scissors or interpretive dance.
</h2>
<h1>11. Amendments
</h1>
<h2>We may update these terms anytime we feel like it. Check back often—or don’t. We’ll let you know telepathically.

Thank you for visiting! By staying here, you’ve already agreed to everything above. Enjoy your stay, and remember: we’re watching. Not in a creepy way, just… monitoring. Okay, maybe a little creepy.

Now go click some buttons, you brave soul!</h2>
